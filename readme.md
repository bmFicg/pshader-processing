### i don't even know, what i'm doing here

Going trough some OpenGL tutorials mostly converting C++ Code to Processing 3.3

I run into few bugs, I can not say yet if it's my fault or it's a bug, i will invisitage.

Note this is a work in progress folder, yes, few things could be improved, i also don't want to edit the files everytime i learn something new. 

+ Hacking   
+ Less Notes more Code
+ No or Bad Coding Syle ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ
